🎬 Intelligent Movie Recommender System
This project is an intelligent, content-based movie recommender system built using FAISS for similarity search, sentence-transformer for vector embeddings, TMDb API for fetching movie posters, and Groq’s LLM (via Langchain) for natural language explanation of recommendations.


🚀 Features
🔍 Semantic Vector Search using Sentence Transformers

🎯 FAISS-based Similarity Engine

🎞️ Movie Poster Display using TMDb API

🧠 Explainable Recommendations using Groq’s LLM with LangChain

🎛️ Genre-based Filtering

🖥️ Interactive Web UI using Streamlit

3. Add API Keys
Set the following environment variables or use st.secrets in Streamlit:

GROQ_API_KEY — from Groq API

TMDB_API_KEY — from The Movie Database (TMDb)

4. Run the App
bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
💡 How It Works
Vectorization: Movies are embedded using sentence-transformers (e.g. all-MiniLM-L6-v2).

FAISS Indexing: Embeddings are indexed with FAISS for fast similarity search.

Poster Fetching: Posters are retrieved via TMDb movie IDs.

Explanation Engine: The Langchain-Groq LLM explains why the movie is recommended.

Filtering: Users can optionally filter recommendations by genre.
