# üé¨ Intelligent Movie Recommender System

This project is a content-based, intelligent movie recommender system developed during the Elevate Labs internship. It leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing to deliver personalized, explainable movie recommendations via a modern web interface.

## üöÄ Features

- **Semantic Vector Search**: Uses HuggingFace Sentence Transformers to embed movie metadata for precise semantic search.
- **FAISS-based Similarity Engine**: Efficiently indexes embeddings with Facebook's FAISS for fast retrieval.
- **Movie Poster Display**: Fetches high-quality posters using TMDb API.
- **Explainable Recommendations**: Integrates Groq‚Äôs LLM (via LangChain) to provide natural language explanations for each recommendation.
- **Genre-based Filtering**: Allows users to filter recommendations by genre.
- **Interactive Web UI**: Built with Streamlit for a seamless user experience.

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abishekP101/RecommendationSystem.git
   cd RecommendationSystem
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set API Keys:**
   - Obtain your [Groq API key](https://console.groq.com/) and [TMDb API key](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).
   - Set these as environment variables or via Streamlit secrets:
     - `GROQ_API_KEY`
     - `TMDB_API_KEY`

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## üí° How It Works

1. **Vectorization**: Each movie is embedded into a semantic vector using sentence-transformers (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` or similar).
2. **Indexing**: Vectors are normalized and indexed with FAISS for efficient similarity search.
3. **Recommendation**: Given a movie you like, the system finds the most semantically similar movies.
4. **Poster Fetching**: Posters are retrieved via TMDb movie IDs.
5. **Explanation Engine**: LangChain-Groq LLM explains why each movie is recommended.
6. **Filtering**: Recommendations can be filtered by genre for more relevance.

## ‚úÖ TODOs / Enhancements

- Add ratings-based filtering.
- Add user feedback loop.
- Integrate collaborative filtering as a fallback.
- Deploy on Streamlit Cloud or Vercel.
